title: Unit Testing

Unit testing is a way of testing small pieces of your code, such as functions, to ensure they're fulfilling their intended purposes. A unit is essentially a small piece of code, such as a function. Setting up specific testing for smaller pieces of your code helps with test-driven development. Unlike traditional development, test-driven development runs tests frequently as development takes place to ensure everything is working as development progresses. 

There are advantages and disadvantages of test-driven development. You might opt for test-driven development to avoid major defects or long testing periods, instead testing as you go. Some people even say test-driven development results in better code overall. However, the extra frequency of testing will slow down development overall. Additionally, you have to take extra time to write tests from the get-go.
