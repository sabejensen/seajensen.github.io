How do I tackle new topics as a developer?

I don't think I'm a stellar example of how to do it, but I've still managed to get this far in my development existence, somehow. Personally, I've benefited a lot from having good teachers and mentors to help me understand concepts in an interactive setting. But when I'm out in the wild, coding by my lonesome, I have to rely on Google searches and StackOverflow to help me out if I'm stuck.

I think it's important when running searches to start specific, then broaden the question. Ideally, you can find a very specific and recent question with a plethora of explanative, helpful, friendly answers. In the worst case, you find nothing. I tend to start my questions as specific as possible, but if I can't find a solution I'll gradually broaden my search.

"Tutorial Hell" is the phase wherein you have a limited depth of understanding, but you've gotten good enough at looking things up that you can sort of fake it. Personally, I think it's an inevitable period for any programmer learning something new and the only real solution is to keep plugging away at it. If you look up the same problem three times in a week, on the fourth time and afterwards, you'll probably be able to solve it on your own. It's the same learning a new language: at first you're just copying phrases you here, but as you gain mastery you can start to express yourself using your own words.

I learn best by doing. I find reading instructions to be so boring I'd rather die. I'd rather dig into the code and fail 18 times, even if there's an easy solution. I don't think it's something I really need to worry about changing; it's just the way I learn. I do well with sites like freecodecamp that offer puzzles or challenges to illustrate each concept they teach. If I have a concrete goal, I can force myself to look through a video or documentation. But just sitting through a lecture on Javascript is numbing.

The most important thing for any new web developer is to identify the way they learn effectively, then put themselves in an environment where they can consistently do that.
