Who am I? What am I?

Currently, I'm a web development student and a software development engineer. Beyond that, I have a longrunning passion for music and storytelling (be it books, movies, anime, or story-rich video games). I play guitar and I like writing as well. 

My web development knowledge is uneven, for sure. I would say I'm lacking in some fundamental areas. I can barely wrap my mind around regex stuff. At the same time, I'm pretty confident in some specific areas. I have a lot of experience now with React Native and building a cohesive user interface. I'm hoping to round out my skills a bit more this semester.

I like creative puzzle-solving. When I'm able to figure out a problem and get a desired effect, it's a great feeling. A semi-longterm goal I have is to create a Janggi app or website (Korean Chess). I used to play it with my old roommate, but since Covid started we haven't been able to interact and neither of us have been able to find a good online solution to this problem. 

Thanks for reading! I look forward to a brutal semester~
