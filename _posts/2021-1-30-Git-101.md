It would be impossible to have big complex projects or web development team work in general without a service like Git. Git is an open-source version-control system. It allows teams to work on different aspects of a project simultaneously with branches, as well as to merge their work together. 

GitHub is the most popular Git server, but it's not to be confused with Git itself. Github hosts projects and Git repositories. There are other servers that offer a similar service utilizing Git, but GitHub happens to be the most popular. GitHub does offer a place to host repos online. This is beneficial to open-source projects, but companies can also use GitHub to host their projects and restrict access to team members with permissions. 

Git is the version-control system. It can be supplemented with an online server, and the most popular online server is GitHub.
