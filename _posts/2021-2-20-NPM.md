NPM stands for Node Package Manager, and it's one of the most important tools for web and app development. Most people have it installed across their entire machine, and even very entry-level developers have run a few "npm install" commands in their days. NPM provides a terminal client to install and manage package and it also provides an online database of existing packages. The convenience of NPM is immense, with how it installs packages with one command, and also organizes them for you using package.json and package-lock.json. 

An NPM package or module is a file or directory that can be loaded by Node.js. There are millions of them available for free, and they can fulfill purposes big and small. 

The three components of NPM are package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules. Package.json is a blueprint that keeps track of which modules are installed within a project. Most of the time, when you run an "npm install" command within a project, it's building off of package.json. Package-lock.json keeps track of the history of modules you've installed within a project. Node_modules is a directory that contains the actual modules themselves that the project can reference.
